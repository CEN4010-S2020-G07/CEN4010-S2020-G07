		<div>In highschool I got my first job at Winn Dixie, which is a grocery store. I started off as a cashier. Immediately after turning 18 years old, I was promoted to the department lead for the dairy department. My responsibilities included ordering products, stocking shelves, removing out of date products, conducting inventory audits. While taking classes at FAU, the Winn Dixie I worked at got liquidated and I was transferred to another store. At the new location I worked at I was trained in the seafood department and meat department. I worked there for a couple months until I found a new job closer to home. My new job was swim instructing at Goldfish Swim Schools. I was a part of the opening team at Goldfish Swim Schools. Before we opened I did training with the rest of my coworkers in preparation for opening day. After opening I worked in several positions. I was a swim instructor, lifeguard, and a member of the marketing team where I would go to events and promote Goldfish Swim Schools. As we expanded I was promoted to “Deck Supervisor” which meant I was the shift leader for the lifeguards and swim instructors. A few months after that I was later promoted to “Pool Operations Manager.” As Pool Operations Manager I was a part time manager. I would open and close some nights throughout the week. My responsibilities included managing training for all swim instructors, hiring new people, maintenancing the pool/pool pump, balancing chemicals and being “Manager On Duty(MOD).” If there was an emergency at work I was number two as the emergency contact for the facility right behind the “General Manager.” About a year into working at Goldfish Swim School I got an internship at Trivantis that was later bought out by eLearning Brothers. At eLearning Brothers I am a “Quality Assurance Intern.” Where I code in Java to automate test cases for products using Selenium. A majority of the time I do automate test cases; however, when a product is close to being released or updated I do switch to manual testing to test everything that is not yet or can’t be automated. At eLearning Brothers I mainly work on three different products: Lectora, Coursemill, and CenarioVR. I currently work at both eLearning Brothers and Goldfish Swim School part time while going to school full time for computer engineering at FAU. </div>
